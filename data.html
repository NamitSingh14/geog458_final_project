                    <h1>Data Source</h1>
                    <p>
                        We are using the data from the National Centers for Environmental Information. The particular
                        data that interested us is the temperature and precipitation and will be obtained from
                        <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climgrid/">NCEI's data repository</a>. In
                        addition, the main shapefiles that we will be plotting are available <a
                            href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/">here</a>. The data will be from the
                        past two years. And here is an example of one of the datasets included which is Alaska’s average
                        temperature in 2021 (2021.tave.alaska.pnt). It is organized by Latitude, Longitude, and value
                        from each Month.

                    <h1>How to Interpret the Original Data</h1>
                    <p>At first glance, the weather data files look very overwhelming and confusing to read.
                        This is why NCEI’s repository contains a <code>divisional-readme.txt</code> file at
                        <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/divisional-readme.txt">
                            https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/divisional-readme.txt
                        </a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To simplify what the readme file contains, the following are the general rules each follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>All columns besides the first column are the respective weather readings for each
                            consecutive month.
                            For example: In the climdiv-tmaxdv-v1.0.0-20220406 file, the second column is the max
                            temperature reading for January,
                            third column is for February and so on until December which is the thirteenth column>


                        <li>The first column values are interpreted as follows:
                            <ul class="firstlist">
                                <li>First 4 (1-4) digits are the FIPS codes for counties
                                <li>Next 2 (5-6) digits are the element code
                                <li>Last 4 (7-11) digits is the year
                                <li>0101271895: 0101 is the FIP code, 27 is the element code, 1895 is the year
                            </ul>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Element Codes:
                    <ul class="firstlist">
                        <li> 01 = Precipitation
                        <li> 02 = Average Temperature
                        <li> 27 = Maximum Temperature
                        <li> 28 = Minimum Temperature
                    </ul>
                    Note: These are not all the element codes. Only the ones we are concerned with are provided

                    <h1>Preprocessing</h1>
                    <p>All the data preprocessing was done in MS Excel. This could be done in Python using its Pandas
                        module but the required preprocessing was very simple so, MS Excel was sufficient.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Since the first column contains information about the year and county FIPS code, we needed to
                        split up the digits into separate columns. MS Excel has a function `MID` which lets you extract
                        a sub-string from a given string. Using that, the first column was split into `FIPS_CD` and
                        `Years` column for all files.
                        Then columns for the months were created by entering `January` for the third column header and
                        letting MS Excel autofill the rest of the months.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The provided shape files contain the county FIPS code and the column is named `FIPS_CD`. This is
                        why in the processed weather data files, the county FIPS code column was also named `FIPS_CD`.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        However, MS Excel broke the data since there were a lot of rows present. To address this, we
                        exported the data to a PostgreSQL database and using its PostGIS plugin we joined the shapefiles
                        with weather data files. Afterwards, the joined datasets were exported into QGIS to help us
                        export it as GeoJSON files.
