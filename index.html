    <h2>About the project</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p class="data-text">
      Through this project, we will attempt to visualize minimum and maximum
      temperatures across the counties in the United States, along with the
      precipitation rate. Since the idea is to showcase climate change, the
      project will have the temperature and precipitation readings from
      different years. This project would be intended for the general public,
      specifically those who have an interest in the chosen location (the
      U.S). This could also benefit climate change activists and other people
      trying to study climate change in any location in the USA.

    <h2>Project Impact</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p class="data-text">
      Understanding climate change and the patterns in
      temperature/precipitation changes can help us keep the ecosystem in a
      healthy condition. If we are ignorant about climate change, it can cause
      natural disasters, and human health issues, and damage both man-made and
      natural systems. This project should make it easier for people to
      visualize climate change and take appropriate action.
