# Climate Change in the USA over the last 100 years

### Project Idea
The project idea is to visualize minimum and maximum temperatures across the counties in the United States, along with the precipitation. Since the idea is to showcase climate change, the project will have the temperature and precipitation readings from different years.

### Significance and Broader Impacts
We will be using data from the National Centers for Environmental Information. The particular data that interested us is the temerature and perciptaion and will be obtain from [NCEI's data repository](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climgrid/). 
In addition, the main shapefiles that we will be plotting on are available [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/). The data will be of the past two years. And here is an example of one of the dataset included which is the Alaska’s average temperature in 2021 (2021.tave.alaska.pnt). It is organized by Latitude, Longitude and value from each Month. 

### Primary Functions
Some reasonable functions that we can create are having states clickable to get a better view of the stats for the state. Another implementation we hope to have is different mapping types of the data for example heatmap with different color options. Lastly, another function we plan to implement is comparing each state’s data vs the average across the United States. We think this last feature would be important for the target audience as numbers alone generally do not mean much if you are not comparing it to a set standard. 

### Target Audience
This project would be intended for the general public, specifically those who have an interest in the chosen location (the U.S). 

### Multimedia
- An interactive map is definitely required where we can show temperatures and precipitations over a given time period

- A markdown or a text file which lists dataset sources, the process of making those maps and difficulties with working real data
